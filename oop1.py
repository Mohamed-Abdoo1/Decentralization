STYLES OF WRITING IN PYTHON.
1-> Structured programing :is the programing paradigm aimed at improving clarity,quality and development time .
 it involves solving problems step by step using top down approach .

 Characteristics:
A-> Top down Approach: BREAKING DOWN PROBLEM INTO smaller manageable pieces .
B-> Focus on procedure: writing functions and prodecures to perform specific tasks .
    eg: writing a functions to calculate the sum of numbers.

2-> Object oriented programing(OOP): this is  the programing paradigm that uses objects to design software . it is 
    based for the concept of real world entities .

 Characteristics:
 A-> Classes and Objects: centeral to OOP where a classes is a blue print(original) and an object is an instance(duplicate) of a class
    eg: Designing program based on real world objects like Car,Student or Animal .
    Ablue print is a master copy (a class) of an object where things an object is a duplicate of the original thing (class)
    There for an object belong to class.
    Classes are written in singular eg: class Student .
B-> Classes give us characteristics of objects.
C-> If you want to identify a class of an object we use "is a"

KEY CONCEPTS/TERMS IN OOP:
1. Abstraction: This is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the neccessary parts 1.e this is a level
   of representation . it helps in identifying the essential characteristics of objects .
2. Inheritance: This is mechanism by which one class can inherit atribute and method from another class it promotes code readibity .
3. Polymorphism: This allows objects to br treated as instances of thier parent class rathet than their actual class .
   it means many forms .
4. Encapsulation: This is bundling (atributes) of data and method (functions) that operates on the data into single unit or class .
   it also restricts a direct access to some object components.
5. Overloading: This allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters .
6. Overriding: This occurs when subclass provides specific implementation of method that is already provided  by its 
   parrent class. in other words the subclass replaces the inherited method by its own implementation.
