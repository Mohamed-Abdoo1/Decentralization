Certainly! Letâ€™s go through the code line by line:

```python
def tests(test1, test2):
    if test1 == test2:
        return test1
    else:
        return test2
```
def tests(test1, test2):`: This line defines a function named `tests` that takes two parameters, `test1` and `test2`.
if test1 == test2:`: This line checks if `test1` is equal to `test2`.
return test1`: If the condition is true (i.e., both test scores are the same), this line returns the value of `test1`.
else:`: If `test1` is not equal to `test2`, the code in this block will be executed.
return test2`: This line returns the value of `test2` if the two test scores are not equal.

python
def courseWrk(cswork, test1, test2):
    testsMark = tests(test1, test2)
    avgtestsCswork = (cswork + testsMark) / 2
    fnltestsCswork = avgtestsCswork * (40 / 100)
    print('..............................')
    print('Your final coursework marks is: ', fnltestsCswork)
    print('..............................')
```
def courseWrk(cswork, test1, test2):`: This line defines a function named `courseWrk` that takes three parameters: `cswork`, `test1`, and `test2`.
testsMark = tests(test1, test2)`: This line calls the `tests` function with `test1` and `test2` as arguments and assigns the result to the variable `testsMark`.
avgtestsCswork = (cswork + testsMark) / 2: This line calculates the average of the coursework marks (`cswork`) and the test mark (`testsMark`). The result is assigned to `avgtestsCswork`.
fnltestsCswork = avgtestsCswork  (40 / 100)`: This line calculates the final coursework marks by taking 40% of the average calculated in the previous line. The result is assigned to `fnltestsCswork`.
print('..............................'): This line prints a line of dots for visual separation in the output.
print('Your final coursework marks is: ', fnltestsCswork)`: This line prints the final coursework marks, formatted with a message.
print('..............................'): This line prints another line of dots for visual separation in the output.

python
# Get input from the user
test1 = int(input('Please enter Marks for test one: '))
test2 = int(input('Please enter Marks for test two: '))
cswork = int(input('Please enter your coursework Marks: '))
```
test1 = int(input('Please enter Marks for test one: ')): This line prompts the user to enter marks for the first test, converts the input to an integer, and stores it in the variable `test1`.
test2 = int(input('Please enter Marks for test two: ')): This line prompts the user to enter marks for the second test, converts the input to an integer, and stores it in the variable `test2`.
cswork = int(input('Please enter your coursework Marks: '))`: This line prompts the user to enter their coursework marks, converts the input to an integer, and stores it in the variable `cswork`.

```python
# Call the courseWrk function with the inputs
courseWrk(cswork, test1, test2)
```
courseWrk(cswork, test1, test2): This line calls the `courseWrk` function, passing `cswork`, `test1`, and `test2` as arguments. This executes the function to calculate and print the final coursework marks based on the provided inputs.
